          Imam Mahdi (a.j.) is the son of Imam Hasan al-Askari (pbuh) and a
          descendant of the Prophet of Islam (pbuh). He holds the position of
          Imamate and is infallible, meaning he is free from any error or
          mistake and, through divine knowledge, is fully responsible for
          guiding people. Imam Mahdi (a.j.) is God’s proof on earth and the
          final leader of truth, who will appear at the appointed time after a
          long period of occultation to reform and restore the world.

          Imam Mahdi (a.j.) entered the period of occultation from childhood,

        <ul className="ml-4 list-inside list-disc">
          <li>
            Minor Occultation: a short period during which he was in limited
            contact with some of his followers.
          </li>
          <li>
            Major Occultation: the long and current period, hidden from public
            view, with the time of his reappearance known only to God.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          During this period, Imam Mahdi (a.j.) is alive and present, but people
          are not able to meet him directly. His spiritual presence and
          leadership continue, and he is ready to return at the appointed time.
